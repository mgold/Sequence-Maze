Sequence Maze
=============
Max Goldstein & Hamid Mansoor

A game for 3-5yo children to develop "sequencing", the cognitive process of
understanding ordering. The game is a maze with arrows directing the user in
its proper traversal. This sequence is reinforced for color, symbols, sounds, a
physical controller (one day), memory, and planning.
